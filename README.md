#### In the sprint review a number of bugs are detected, among them:

..*the hero was having problem executing the attack in standing/ walking status.
..*There was a gap between the hero/enemy and the tile (they seemed like floating).
..*The hero would disappear when jumping (no scene limits).
..*Further features and improvements are recommended 
..*It was found that it is better to switch the personality of the enemy and the hero. A knight in shiny armor would fit better as a hero, while a soldier in gray armor wouldfit better as an enemy soldier.
